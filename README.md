# Install & run

First, we need to install dependencies.
```
npm install
```
Then run the webservice that will allow you to trigger automatic compilation on file change
```
npm run watch
```

Finally, in another terminal, you can now start the game:
```
npm run start
```

# Side note

I've developped this tool for a year on my free time. I spent a lot on this.
